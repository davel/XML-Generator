0.6   Sun Jun 11 16:02:00 2000
	- Cleaned-up, modularized rewrite courtesy of Bron Gondwana
	  (perlcode@brong.net)
	- XML::Generator now returns objects blessed into XML::Generator::auto
	  which contains only an AUTOLOAD that redirects requests to the
	  proper method in XML::Generator.
	- A new option is available in the constructor to force stricter
	  conformance to the XML specification ('conformance' => 'strict').
	  This also enables some special tags; "xmlpi", "xmlcmnt", "xmldecl"
	  and "xmlcdata" that can be used to generate, respectively, processing
	  instructions, comments, the XML declaration, and character data
	  sections. 

0.7   Mon Jun 13 09:14:32 2000
	- Pretty-printing patch from Bron Gondwana
	- Undefined warnings patch from Bron Gondwana

0.8   Wed Jul 12 17:10:12 2000
	- Bug-fix for pretty-printing
	- New special tag, "xml" which takes a complete XML document and
	  "finalizes" it, so it can't be further embedded.
	- Arguments passed as scalar refs will not be escaped, even if the
	  XML::Generator object was constructed with the 'escape' => "always"
	  option.

0.9   Sat Nov 18 11:13:24 2000
	- Massive code reorganization to support subclassing, courtesy of
	  Nathan Winger (nate@nateware.com)
	- New instantiation option, 'empty', to control how empty tags are
	  rendered.
	- Improved internal representation for improved performance
	  ( $gen->foo($gen->bar($gen->baz( $really_big_string ))) used to copy
	  $really_big_string three times; as long as the 'pretty' option is not
	  supplied, this is no longer the case. )
	- Fixed xml() tag to allow comments and processing instructions before
	  and/or after the xml document.
	- New special tag, xmldtd(), which used to be part of xmldecl().

0.91  Mon Dec 11 11:33:32 2000
	- Added XML::Generator::DOM subclass for producing DOM trees instead of
	  strings.
	- New choices for the 'empty' option: 'compact' and 'args'.
	- Changed the semantics of 'pretty' option; CDATA sections and Processing
	  Instructions are no longer subject to the pretty printing rules.  Thanks
	  for the bug report from Murat Uenalan.
	- Using closures for tag generation, which seems to save a little bit of
	  time.  Might not be worth it in the long run, for maintainability's sake.
	- Fix for perl versions that can't use 'for' as a statement modifier (pre 5.005)
	  courtesy of Neil Prockter (n.prockter@lse.ac.uk).
	- Some documentation fixups.

0.92  Tue Jan 21 13:12:00 2003
	- Finally (after multiple bug reports) stopped requiring that XML::DOM be
	  installed for the tests to pass.  Sorry this took so long to get fixed.
	- Also fixed a bug in XML::Generator::DOM's POD that made it look strange
	  on search.cpan.org (reported by Ken Williams).

0.93  Wed Jan 22 10:41:00 2003
	- Added 'high-bit' option to escape to allow escaping of upper ASCII.
	- Fixed a test bug that assumed the order of elements in a hash.

0.94  Sun Feb 29 14:21:00 2004
	- FIXED IMPLEMENTATION OF NAMESPACES!! XML::Generator is now conformant.
	  Note that the semantics of namespaces have changed!
	- Implemented AUTOLOAD exporting to simplify syntax.
	- Implement STACKED AUTOLOADs to simplify sub-classing.
	- Added "macro" options ':standard', ':std', ':strict' and ':pretty'.
	- Added new 'allowed_xml_tags' option to allow tags starting with 'xml'
	  under strict conformance.
	- Documented the 'version', 'encoding' and 'dtd' options.
	- Added arguments to xmldecl() to allow more control.
	- Changed XML comment behavior when escaping '--' to escape both dashes.
	- Fixed memory leak in constructor. Bug #4513.
	- Fixed bug in t/DOM.t that caused it to fail when DOM.pm was installed. Bug #3220.

0.95  Sun Feb 29 22:21:00 2004
	- Enhanced STACKED AUTOLOAD feature to provide a default import()
	- Documentation fixups.

0.96  Sun Feb 29 23:00:00 2004
	- More documentation fixups.
	- Only check for xml() subs under strict conformance.
	- Small performance optimizations.

	- Fixed bugs in DOM.t reported by David Wheeler.

0.98  Mon Mar  1 18:26:00 2004
	- Fixed bug in DOM.t when XML::DOM not installed (caused by fix in 0.97)

0.99  Tue Mar 23 11:17:00 2004
	- Removed automatic prefixing of attribute names when using a namespace.
	- Added 'qualifiedAttributes' constructor option to emulate prior attribute
	  prefixing behavior.
	- Always syntax check attribute names under strict conformance.
	- Add documentation on using Tie::IxHash to get predictable attribute ordering.
	- Allow tag 'AUTOLOAD'.
	- Fixed bug with default namespace.
	- More tests
