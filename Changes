0.6   Sun Jun 11 16:02:00 2000
	- Cleaned-up, modularized rewrite courtesy of Bron Gondwana
	  (perlcode@brong.net)
	- XML::Generator now returns objects blessed into XML::Generator::auto
	  which contains only an AUTOLOAD that redirects requests to the
	  proper method in XML::Generator.
	- A new option is available in the constructor to force stricter
	  conformance to the XML specification ('conformance' => 'strict').
	  This also enables some special tags; "xmlpi", "xmlcmnt", "xmldecl"
	  and "xmlcdata" that can be used to generate, respectively, processing
	  instructions, comments, the XML declaration, and character data
	  sections. 

0.7   Mon Jun 13 09:14:32 2000
	- Pretty-printing patch from Bron Gondwana
	- Undefined warnings patch from Bron Gondwana

0.8   Wed Jul 12 17:10:12 2000
	- Bug-fix for pretty-printing
	- New special tag, "xml" which takes a complete XML document and
	  "finalizes" it, so it can't be further embedded.
	- Arguments passed as scalar refs will not be escaped, even if the
	  XML::Generator object was constructed with the 'escape' => "always"
	  option.
