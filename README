XML::Generator - A module to help in generating XML documents

Version 0.91 - 2000.12.11
- Added XML::Generator::DOM subclass for producing DOM trees instead of
  strings.
- New choices for the 'empty' option: 'compact' and 'args'.
- Changed the semantics of 'pretty' option; CDATA sections and Processing
  Instructions are no longer subject to the pretty printing rules.  Thanks
  for the bug report from Murat Uenalan.
- Using closures for tag generation, which seems to save a little bit of
  time.  Might not be worth it in the long run, for maintainability's sake.
- Fix for perl versions that can't use 'for' as a statement modifier (pre 5.005)
  courtesy of Neil Prockter (n.prockter@lse.ac.uk).
- Some documentation fixups.
