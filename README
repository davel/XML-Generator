XML::Generator - A module to help in generating XML documents

Version 0.9 - 2000.11.18

- Massive code reorganization to support subclassing, courtesy of
  Nathan Winger (nate@nateware.com)
- New instantiation option, 'empty', to control how empty tags are
  rendered.
- Improved internal representation for improved performance
  ( $gen->foo($gen->bar($gen->baz( $really_big_string ))) used to copy
  $really_big_string three times; as long as the 'pretty' option is not
  supplied, this is no longer the case. )
- Fixed xml() tag to allow comments and processing instructions before
  and/or after the xml document.
- New special tag, xmldtd(), which used to be part of xmldecl().
