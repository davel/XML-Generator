XML::Generator - A module to help in generating XML documents

Version 0.92 - 2003.1.21
- Finally (after multiple bug reports) stopped requiring that XML::DOM be
  installed for the tests to pass.  Sorry this took so long to get fixed.
- Also fixed a bug in XML::Generator::DOM's POD that made it look strange
  on search.cpan.org (reported by Ken Williams).
