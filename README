XML::Generator - A simple module to help in generating XML documents

Version 0.6 - 2000.06.11

- Cleaned-up, modularized rewrite courtesy of Bron Gondwana
  (perlcode@brong.net)
- XML::Generator now returns objects blessed into XML::Generator::auto
  which contains only an AUTOLOAD that redirects requests to the
  proper method in XML::Generator.
- A new option is available in the constructor to force stricter
  conformance to the XML specification ('conformance' => 'strict').
  This also enables some special tags; "xmlpi", "xmlcmnt", "xmldecl"
  and "xmlcdata" that can be used to generate, respectively, processing
  instructions, comments, the XML declaration, and character data
  sections.
