XML::Generator - A module to help in generating XML documents

Version 0.8 - 2000.07.12

- Bug-fix for pretty-printing
- New special tag, "xml" which takes a complete XML document and
  "finalizes" it, so it can't be further embedded.
- Arguments passed as scalar refs will not be escaped, even if the
  XML::Generator object was constructed with the 'escape' => "always"
  option.
